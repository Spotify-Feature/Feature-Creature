## Overview
### Description
Analyzes the different features of a Spotify user's songs and playlists, and allows them to share with friends/followers through created posts.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking/Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes Spotify users' music features, and connects them to other users with similar features. The user can follow other users, and create posts about their playlists and favorite music.
- **Market:** Anyone could choose to use this app, particularly music enthusiasts, and Spotify users. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how passionate they are about their music choices and their curiosity to discover new music through others. 
- **Scope:** First, we would start with allowing users to choose which particular features of their songs they would like to see. Then, they could share their stats through a post or create a post related to any song/playlist, and link it.
